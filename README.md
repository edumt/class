In this repository you will find several exercises to help you familiarize yourself with
the Kind language and HVM, they are organized in such a way where your can gradually gain experience and be enabled to take on harder and harder challenges. 

To install Kind you can follow this tutorial [Kind](https://github.com/Kindelia/Kind#readme) and [HVM](https://github.com/Kindelia/HVM#readme). 

If you look into the HVM folder, you will find basics lists of exercises: Boolean and Natural Lists and etc.

Inside the Kind directory there are 3 folders: 

"Exercises" for regular functional exercises.
"Games" games where you can apply the knowledge you gained on "Exercises".
"Theorems" for theorem proving exercises, the endgame.

We suggest that you do them in the following order:
Kind Exercises -> Games -> Theorems -> HVM exercises~

And read the gitbook for better understanding of the language.
